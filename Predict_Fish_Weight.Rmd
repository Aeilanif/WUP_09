# Predicting Fish Weight


## Perch

```{r}
Fish <- read.csv("Fish.csv")
perch <- filter(Fish, Species == "Perch")
```

```{r}
perch <- select(perch,-Species)
```

### Best Models

We find best models for all three species.

### Best Two regressor model

```{r}
perchmodel <- lm(Weight ~ Height + Width, data = perch)
summary.lm(perchmodel)
```

The best two regressor model is height and weight because those are the highest adjusted r squared.

## Pike
```{r}
Pike = filter(Fish, Species == 'Pike')
Pike = subset(Pike,select = -Species)
weightPike =lm(Weight~Length1 + Length2 + Length3 + Height+ Width, data =Pike)
summary.lm(weightPike)
```

### Best Two regressor model


## Roach
